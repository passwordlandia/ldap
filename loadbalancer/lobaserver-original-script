###1. Install Dependencies###

yum install epel-release -y
yum update -y
yum install python-pip -y
sudo pip install --upgrade pip
yum install nginx -y
yum -y install wget

yum install python34-devel gcc -y
curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
/usr/bin/python3.4 get-pip.py

pip install virtualenv
mkdir -p /var/www && cd /var/www
virtualenv -p python3 p3venv

source p3venv/bin/activate
pip install uwsgi
pip install django

###2. Configurations###

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/passwordlandia/ldap/master/loadbalancer/apivndeveloper.conf

### Any *.conf file inside this folder will be loaded as per instructed by main & default NGINX configuration (/etc/nginx/nginx.conf).###

systemctl enable nginx
systemctl start nginx

###As of now, we have NGINX serves static files and by pass others to Django Server which will be configured shortly.###
###It means you will get 502 bad gateway when accessing http://api.vndeveloper.com but this is totally fine.###

cd /var/www
django-admin.py startproject apivndeveloper

### Also allow domain (api.vndeveloper.com) or IP in Django settings. I'll have to write a sed line to:
###(/var/www/apivndeveloper/apivndeveloper/settings.py)###

python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 ("ctrl + c" to terminate)
uwsgi --http :8000 --module apivndeveloper.wsgi ("ctrl + c" to terminate)

# Create 'uwsgi' user: unprivileged user
useradd -s /bin/false -r uwsgi

##Emperor mode###
###create a directory for the vassals###

- mkdir -p /etc/uwsgi/vassals

###Configuring uWSGI to run with a .ini file using this path###
### /var/www/apivndeveloper/apivndeveloper_uwsgi.ini###

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/passwordlandia/ldap/master/loadbalancer/uwsgi.ini

ln -s /var/www/apivndeveloper/apivndeveloper_uwsgi.ini /etc/uwsgi/vassals/

###Quick test if the configuration is good by start uWSGI server and navigate to http://api.vndeveloper.com.###
###You should get “It worked! Congratulations on your first Django-powered page.”###

/var/www/p3venv/bin/uwsgi --emperor /etc/uwsgi/vassals

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/passwordlandia/ldap/master/loadbalancer/uwsgi.service

###the path to this file is vi /etc/systemd/system/uwsgi.service###

systemctl stop nginx
systemctl start uwsgi
systemctl start nginx

###FINAL THOUGHTS FROM AUTHOR###
### am still stuck at apivndeveloper_uwsgi.ini with chmod-socket = 666.###
###Whenever I change it to chmod-socket = 664, I get 502 bad gateway.###
###If someone knows the cause and how to fix it, please let me know.###
###BELOW IS THE RESPONSE IN COMMENTS FROM A USER###
###It appears to me that you are accessing your site via uWSGI directly.### 
###If you want to use it (uWSGI), then just change the port from 8000 to 80 or you can serve all requests via nginx (proxy).###
